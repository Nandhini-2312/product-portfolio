# Case Study: Qube Cinemas – ERP/Service Ticketing

## Context
Qube Cinemas is a leader in cinema technology and media services, supporting multiple venues and partners. Service and equipment issues were reported via ERP but lacked a clear tracking and resolution lifecycle.

## Problem
ERP-generated tickets were hard to monitor after creation, with unclear assignment, status changes, and missed handoffs. Delays and miscommunication persisted due to fragmented workflows.

## My Role
- Designed and configured ticket lifecycle flows from creation to resolution.
- Mapped and built the process in Fieldproxy’s mobile/web platform using JSON scripting.
- Developed, tested, and validated integration with their ERP system using SQL/PL-SQL.
- Supported go-live and troubleshooting with both Qube and internal engineering teams.

## Approach
- Mapped out lifecycle steps with the client and engineering to define business logic.
- Connected the Fieldproxy platform to their backend, ensuring data mapping and field compatibility.
- Created real-time reporting and history views for support and management teams.
- Conducted edge case testing and iterative improvements post-launch.

## Solution
- Centralized, automated service ticket tracking with mobile app for field engineers.
- Status transitions (created, assigned, in progress, resolved) with clear audit trails.
- Reliable integration with ERP, reducing data silos and manual interventions.

## Impact
- Reduced ticket resolution times by estimated 25%.
- Management gained full visibility on active and resolved tickets.
- Field staff adoption improved through ease of use and real-time updates.

## Learnings & Next Steps
I learned to bridge ERP systems with modern workflow tools, delivering both technical reliability and user-centric design. In the future, I would build on this by adding automated notifications and tighter analytics to further streamline support.
