## Case Studies

### AnandRathi – Finance & CIBIL Module

**Context:**  
AnandRathi is a financial services company where field users visit customers to collect loan-related data. Users input visit details and loan targets in a mobile app, while area sales managers (ASMs) monitor progress and performance on a web dashboard.

**Problem:**  
The client needed a streamlined way to track loan targets versus visits made and to manage credit-related data via their CIBIL module. They also wanted real-time display of CIBIL scores for applicants, co-applicants, and guarantors, with downloadable signed PDFs linked to TransUnion CIBIL.

**My Role:**  
I gathered requirements from finance and ops teams, mapped workflows for field visits and loan targets, and configured the mobile and web apps using JSON-based low-code builders.

**Approach:**  
- Designed mobile forms for user data input, including visits and loan target entry.  
- Developed web dashboards for ASMs to track actual visits against targets.  
- Configured the CIBIL section with fields for applicants, co-applicants, and guarantors, integrating API calls to TransUnion to fetch and display CIBIL scores dynamically.  
- Enabled CIBIL report PDF generation and download features within the app.  
- Collected client feedback iteratively and updated validations and UI flow accordingly.

**Solution:**  
A dual mobile/web app setup where users enter visit data and loan targets on mobile, ASMs monitor progress via web dashboards, and CIBIL scores with downloadable reports are accessible. The system improved loan monitoring and credit operations seamlessly.

**Impact:**  
- Reduced manual paperwork and spreadsheets by 80%.  
- ASMs could proactively manage branches exceeding or lagging behind targets.  
- Client credit operations became more data-driven and auditable.

**Learnings:**  
Working closely with credit risk and sales teams helped me understand complex compliance and reporting needs, sharpening my requirements gathering and user flow design skills.

### Qube Cinemas – ERP Ticket & Asset Management

**Context:**  
Qube Cinemas operates over 1000 screens and needed a robust system to manage service tickets, installations, and theatre asset tracking, integrated tightly with their ERP.

**Problem:**  
Before, service teams struggled to track equipment issues, installations, and asset maintenance reliably. The client required a workflow that automated service ticket creation and tracking from ERP data.

**My Role:**  
I designed and configured workflows for ticket lifecycle management, integrating ERP database fields with low-code JSON app builders and SQL/PLSQL queries.

**Approach:**  
- Mapped ERP-derived equipment & theatre asset data flows.  
- Built mobile and web apps to create, assign, and track service tickets.  
- Configured SQL/PLSQL connectors to sync tickets with ERP tables for real-time status and updates.  
- Coordinated with client teams for testing edge cases, verifying data consistency, and final solution rollout.

**Solution:**  
A connected service ticketing platform syncing with ERP, enabling seamless issue tracking across thousands of screens, improving response coordination and asset uptime.

**Impact:**  
- Streamlined ticket processing, reducing manual tracking errors by over 70%.  
- Improved asset visibility and responsiveness, enhancing customer experience.

**Learnings:**  
This taught me the importance of robust data integration and collaboration across technical and non-technical teams in large-scale environments.

### BIC (Prism Johnson) – Offline Lead Management

**Context:**  
BIC, operating in manufacturing, needed offline mode capabilities to handle leads and field visits where network connectivity was intermittent.

**Problem:**  
Field users required a solution to capture leads and visits offline, syncing data later when online, ensuring no data loss and smooth operations.

**My Role:**  
Configured offline-capable workflows and apps, enabling lead capture and visit recording with sync features once connectivity resumed.

**Approach:**  
- Designed mobile data capture with local storage for offline usage.  
- Set up sync mechanisms to upload data when back online.  
- Tested extensively with field users, iterating to ensure reliability and ease of use.

**Solution:**  
A robust offline-first mobile app allowing seamless lead and visit logging, improving field data quality in low-connectivity areas.

**Impact:**  
- Increased data capture accuracy by 50% in remote areas.  
- Reduced lead loss and improved follow-up rates.

**Learnings:**  
This project enhanced my understanding of offline-first design and user empathy for field constraints.

### Indigo Paints – Attendance and Visit Tracking

**Context:**  
Indigo Paints required a solution to track employee attendance, site visits, and location data for field teams.

**Problem:**  
Manual attendance and visit tracking led to inaccuracies and low visibility into field operations.

**My Role:**  
Configured mobile apps for attendance logging with location tracking and visit record management, building web dashboards for supervisors.

**Approach:**  
- Implemented GPS-based attendance capture.  
- Designed visit workflows linked to attendance data.  
- Built dashboards showing attendance summaries, visit counts, and location maps.

**Solution:**  
Digital attendance and visit management system improving transparency and accountability.
