# Case Study: AnandRathi – CIBIL Workflows

## Context
AnandRathi is a prominent financial services firm specializing in credit and CIBIL module workflows. Their operations demanded tighter controls and greater transparency for managing credit checks and follow-ups, previously spread across spreadsheets and disjointed tools.

## Problem
Manual tracking of CIBIL checks led to slow turnarounds, missed follow-ups, and poor visibility across stakeholders. The finance team struggled with inefficiencies, lack of unified status dashboards, and required too much oversight to prevent errors and delays.

## My Role
- Led requirements discovery with finance and ops stakeholders.
- Mapped end-to-end CIBIL processes and user flows for field and back-office.
- Configured field/web apps via JSON and set up custom reports in Redash/Metabase.
- Iterated on designs/fields based on ongoing client feedback and real user observations.

## Approach
- Facilitated calls and workshops to detail required steps and edge cases.
- Translated processes into actionable flows and configured them in our low-code builder.
- Built SQL queries for real-time reports, ensuring key data fields and statuses were tracked end-to-end.
- Coordinated UAT/testing with client, refining user experience and field validations.

## Solution
- Deployed a unified workflow for CIBIL checks accessible to both on-ground and office users.
- Dashboards showing pending checks, follow-ups by status, and actionable insights.
- Configurable fields/validations, with automated status transitions, reducing manual updates.

## Impact
- Reduced manual follow-ups and data entry by >30%.
- Increased visibility resulted in quicker decisions and accountability.
- Stakeholders reported higher confidence in accuracy and timeliness of operations.

## Learnings & Next Steps
This project honed my skills in requirement mapping and adapting low-code tools for real business complexity. I learned to prioritize field usability and flexible reporting, and would next work on automating escalations and integrating notification flows to further streamline operations.
